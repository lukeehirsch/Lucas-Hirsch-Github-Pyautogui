 Some of my work, automation and UI tasks

In this repository you will find some bots that some clients were asking me to do (and allowing them to show) about how it facilitated their diffusion, posting or other tasks. In each folder there is a video of the bot running and a brief sample of the code used. 
Several automation tasks contained sensitive and personal information of each client, these are shown as an illustration to get an idea of the potential of the bots, I hope you like it!
